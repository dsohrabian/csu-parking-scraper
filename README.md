# csu-parking-scraper

Simple scraper script that obtains parking availability numbers from Cleveland State University's live parking portal.
Intended to run on schedule such as on Task Scheduler or left running in background

Still testing accuracy, consistency and usefulness of source. The intended purpose is to see how overbuilt the parking facilities are. The main issue on data source is whether capacity is dictated by arbitrary number of managed spaces or if it reflects actual physical capacity.

Will be posting my data here from running script here too.
